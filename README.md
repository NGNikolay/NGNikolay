 I have about 20 years of working experiance in international companies in the fields of sales, marketing and management.

 I'm currently working hard to develop myself as a Front-end developer with a desire to dig deep in that field. Where I go next in my studies in the following monts is to learn and get skilled in the technologies shown below, beacuse I strongly believe that they will help me build really usefull and beautifull apps.
