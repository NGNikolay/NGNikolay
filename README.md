<p align="center">
 I have many years of working experience in international companies in the fields of sales, marketing and management. I've reached a point in my life where I want to be close to my family and to do things for living that I really enjoy. And I really enjoy creating things. Things that can be useful to others.

 I'm currently working hard to develop myself as a Front-end developer with a desire to dig deep in that field. In the following months I'm planning to learn and get skilled in the technologies shown below, because I strongly believe that they will help me build really useful and beautiful apps.
